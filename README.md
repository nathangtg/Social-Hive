<p align="center">Social Hive is a side portfolio project that was made with the help of ReactJS, Laravel, OpenAdmin, and Inertia. This project also uses front-end tooling such as Tailwind and Bootstrap, therefore, this website utilizes the use of Server Side Rendering and, in this case, it can boost the website's performance. It also emphasizes on security principles such as file name and password hashing and server side rendering.</p>

<p>
Built With
ReactJS - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Laravel - A PHP framework for web artisans
OpenAdmin - Administration panel (replace with actual link/documentation)
Inertia - A framework for building single-page applications without leaving the comfort of Laravel
Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework
Bootstrap - For responsive design and UI components
    
Security
- Social Hive prioritizes security, implementing features like:
- Filename hashing to prevent direct access and guessing of resource URLs.
- Password hashing for secure storage and verification of user credentials.
